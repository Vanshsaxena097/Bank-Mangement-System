This BMS's main goal is to transform banking data management through operational efficiency through the use of AVL Trees. A balanced binary search tree variation called an AVL tree provides logarithmic time complexity for important operations such as search, insertion, and deletion. This innate efficiency makes it possible to quickly access and manipulate enormous amounts of data, which is essential for account management and real-time transaction processing.

An extensive examination of the application of AVL Trees within the framework of a bank management system is presented in this study. It clarifies the design concepts, features, and benefits of using AVL Trees to manage customer accounts, guarantee data integrity, streamline transaction processing, and give banking staff a safe yet user-friendly interface.
